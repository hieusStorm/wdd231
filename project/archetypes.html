            <h2>Arechtypes</h2>
            <p>What is an archetype? In Magic: The Gathering, an archetype refers to the overarching strategy that a
                deck employs. It serves as a framework that guides card selection and influences why specific cards are
                included. By defining the deck’s playstyle, archetypes help players understand their strategy and the
                optimal approach to achieving victory.</p>

                    <h3>Aggro</h3>
                    <p>Aggro decks are designed to win games quickly, focusing on fast-paced offense. They typically
                        achieve this by aggressively attacking with creatures or employing low-cost spells to deal
                        direct damage to the opponent.</p>

                <section class="tile">
                    <h3>Control</h3>
                    <p>Control decks are crafted to secure victory by first establishing dominance over the game and
                        preventing opponents from gaining a foothold. Typically, these decks operate in two phases: the
                        control phase and the finisher phase. In the control phase, players utilize various forms of
                        removal and disruption to stifle the opponent’s strategy and prevent any significant advantages.
                        Once control is firmly established, the deck transitions to the finisher phase, where victory is
                        achieved through leveraging board advantage and deploying powerful threats.</p>

                <section class="tile">
                    <h3>Combo</h3>
                    <p>Combo decks aim to secure victory through specific combinations of cards. Typically, this is an
                        A+B approach, where playing card A alongside card B leads directly to winning the game.
                        Occasionally, combo decks are built around an engine—a set of cards designed to generate ongoing
                        value or facilitate a win condition. While these engines may not end the game immediately, their
                        repeated use can ultimately lead to a decisive victory.</p>

                    <h3>Tempo</h3>
                    <p>Tempo decks aim to win by blending aggressive and control strategies. Typically featuring
                        low-cost creatures, these decks switch between an aggressive play style and a more controlling
                        approach. Tempo decks focus on setting the pace of the game, using fast, efficient threats and
                        strategic interactions to maintain an advantage. By applying pressure while also disrupting
                        their opponent’s game plan, they create opportunities to secure victory.</p>

                    <h3>Midrange</h3>
                    <p>Midrange decks serve as a balanced approach between control and combo strategies. They
                        incorporate both explosive win conditions and slower, interactive cards, allowing for
                        versatility in gameplay. These decks can adapt their main strategy based on the current game
                        state, shifting focus to whichever style—aggressive or controlling—best suits the situation.
                        This flexibility enables midrange decks to respond effectively to various opponents and game
                        dynamics.</p>
